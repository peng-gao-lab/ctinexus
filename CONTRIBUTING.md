### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the [repository](https://github.com/peng-gao-lab/CTINexus) to your own GitHub account.

1. **Clone the Fork:** Clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CTINexus
   cd CTINexus
   ```

1. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # .venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

1. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

   This installs git hooks that automatically run code quality checks before each commit.

1. **Configure environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys (OpenAI, Gemini, AWS)
   # OR set up Ollama for local models
   ```

1. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

1. **Make Changes:** Make your changes in your branch.

1. **Format and Lint your code:** Before committing, ensure your code follows our style guidelines:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

1. **Test your changes:** Ensure your changes work correctly:

   ```bash
   ctinexus
   ```

1. **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. Use a category to indicate the type of change. Common categories include:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for new AI provider"
```

If pre-commit hooks are installed, they will automatically run when you commit. If any checks fail, fix the issues and commit again.

11. **Push to Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature-name
```

10. **Open a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository. Include a detailed description of your changes and any related issues.

## Automated Checks

When you open a pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically run code quality checks. These checks must pass before your PR can be merged. If they fail:

1. Review the error messages in the GitHub Actions log
1. Run the checks locally: `ruff check . --fix && ruff format .`
1. Commit and push the fixes
1. The checks will run again automatically

## Code Quality & Style

Please follow the code style used in the project. We use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.

## Review Process

All pull requests are reviewed by our maintainers. We strive to provide feedback promptly, typically within a few days. Thank you for helping to improve CTINexus.
